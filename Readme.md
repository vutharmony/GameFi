<h1 align = "center">GameFi 🎮</h1>


With the rise of blockchain and popularity of NFTs, we also needed a way to make the gaming experience better using this technology. Imagine a user avatar upgrades every second according to the amount of time they spent on that particular game or a weapon gets upgraded after a certain amount of time based on how much time he spent using that weapon. That's why I built GameFi. GameFi is a NFT marketplace that allows you to grow your NFTs using superfluid streams making the NFTs look more alive. Your gaming NFT starts upgrading as soon as you start streaming super tokens to it. GameFi has several games list and with each game several NFTs attached to that particular game. A user can upgrade their NFT by streaming super tokens to it. There are several levels available for each NFT and each NFT can be upgraded to the next level by streaming super tokens to it for a certain amount of time. In the near future this same concept can be used to make the in-game NFTs upgradeable depending on how much a user spends time on that paritcular game.
